Welcome to PMD
==============

PMD scans Java source code and looks for potential problems like:

*   Possible bugs - empty try/catch/finally/switch statements
*   Dead code - unused local variables, parameters and private methods
*   Suboptimal code - wasteful String/StringBuffer usage
*   Overcomplicated expressions - unnecessary if statements, for loops that could be while loops
*   Duplicate code - copied/pasted code means copied/pasted bugs

Download
--------

You can **[download everything from here][1]**, and you can get an overview of all the rules for
e.g. Java at the [rulesets index][2] page.

PMD is [integrated][3] with JDeveloper, Eclipse, JEdit, JBuilder, BlueJ, CodeGuide,
NetBeans/Sun Java Studio Enterprise/Creator, IntelliJ IDEA, TextPad, Maven, Ant, Gel, JCreator, and Emacs.

Changelog
---------

*   See [What's new in PMD ${project.version}][4]
*   Older versions: [Old Changelogs][5]

Future releases
---------------

The next version of PMD will be developed in parallel with this release. We will release additional bugfix
versions as needed.

A [snapshot][6] of the web site for the new version is generated daily by our continuous integration server.

Maven packages are also generated regularly and uploaded to [Sonatypes OSS snapshot repository][7].

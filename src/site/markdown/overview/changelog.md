**API Changes:**

* `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Match.iterator()` now returns an iterator of the new type `net.sourceforge.pmd.cpd.Mark` instead
  of TokenEntry. A `Mark` contains all the informations about each single duplication, including the TokenEntry via `Mark.getToken()`.
  This Mark is useful for reporting the correct line count for each duplication. Previously only one line count was available.
  As for some languages CPD can be instructed to ignore comments, the line count could be different in the different files
  for the same duplication.
